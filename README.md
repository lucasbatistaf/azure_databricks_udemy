# Azure Databricks & Spark Course

Hi everyone, this is my repository for the course from Udemy I just finished;

This was a 10/10 course, very well explained and with very good exercises and examples;

Main technologies used:
1. Spark - PySpark and SparkSQL
2. Databricks
3. Microsoft Azure
4. Delta Lakes
5. Azure Data Factory
6. Databricks Unity Catalog

Course roadmap:
1. First parts of the course are purelly introductory, a proper tour by **Microsoft Azure** and **Databricks interfaces**;
2. Start creating your first **Databricks Notebooks**, linking your Databricks account to Azure, creating access codes and securing them in the **Azure Key Vault**;
3. Creating a Storage Blob in the Azure and mounting the raw data;
4. Introduction to **Spark** and the first ingestion of the data;
5. Tutorials about **PySpark** and **SparkSQL**, using the data and creating the Raw, Processed and Presentation layers (similar to Bronze, Silver and Gold);
6. Then moves to more advanced concepts, such as Incremental load, Delta Lake, adapting all Notebooks created to support such changes;
7. Use of Azure Data Factory, to orquestrate pipelines, to move data around, doing transformations and saving to Delta Lakes, all this done by using Triggers; (very impressive tool)
8. And last but not least, a mini-project using **Databricks Unit Catalog**, creating Bronze, Silver and Gold layers (another very impressive tool)
